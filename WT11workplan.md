Water Tension using DIC : WT11
===============================

*RS, JH, SR*

The point of the next experiment (WT11) is to:

1. confirm that initial water tension explains differences in strain development and after decontraction, and 
1. to determine if holding underwater can relieve initial water tension, and 
1. how long it takes to reach strain equilibrium after mass equilibrium is reached then:

Sample Preparation
---------

1.	Take 8 samples of end matched sample pairs.
2.	As quickly as possible cut and paint samples trying to lose the same amount of moisture from each
3.	Randomly assign one sample from each pair to treatments 'nosoak' and 'soak'
4.	Randomly assign half the 'soak' and half the 'nosoak' samples to 'predry' the other half to 'nopredry'
5.	Temporarily wrap the 'nopredry' samples in gladwrap
6.	Allow the 'predry' samples to lose moisture for 8-24 hrs (not sure how long to leave these, maybe the WT10 results can help you decide)
7.	Immerse both sets of 'soak' samples in clean water and put them in the fridge (probably have to do this before speckling???). maybe add a bit of bleach to the water????
8.	Remove the 'nopredry' samples from gladwrap, apply speckle patterns and start experiment
9.	Run experiment for a week (keep this experiment short to minimize chance of fungi etc growing on samples under water)
10.	Replace 'nosoak' samples with 'soak' samples and run for at least 1200 hrs

DIC Setup and Imaging
---------

Similar to previous, but:

- Use a higher rate of capture (5min) at least initially.
- Include a speckled low density polyethylene sample to monitor thermal strains. This can replace the steel sample used previously.
- Plan to run for 1200 hrs (6 weeks). To fully capture the transverse strain approach to equilibrium.

Analysis
--------

Similar to WT10
